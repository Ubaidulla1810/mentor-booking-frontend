# Mentor Booking Platform

The Mentor Booking Platform is a full-stack web application designed to connect individuals with expert mentors. Users can browse available mentors, view their profiles and availability, and book sessions. Administrators can manage mentor data and availability through backend access.

This repository contains the **React Frontend** application, which provides the user interface. It interacts with a separate **Spring Boot Backend** API.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run the full Mentor Booking Platform application locally, you need to set up and run both the backend and frontend projects.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* **Node.js & npm** (or yarn)
* **Java Development Kit (JDK)** (Version 8 or higher)
* **Maven** (or Gradle)
* **MySQL Server**

### Installation

1.  **Clone Repositories:** Clone both the backend and frontend repositories from GitHub:
    ```bash
    # Clone the backend repository
    git clone https://github.com/Ubaidulla1810/mentor-booking-backend.git

    # Clone the frontend repository
    git clone https://github.com/Ubaidulla1810/mentor-booking-backend/blob/master/README.md
    ```
    Navigate into the respective project directories (`cd mentorbooking` and `cd mb_frontend`).

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    * Follow the instructions in the [Backend README]for setting up the MySQL database and configuring the backend's `application.properties` with your local MySQL credentials.
    * Build and run the backend application. Ensure it is running on `http://localhost:8080` (or the configured port).
    * [Link to Backend README: https://github.com/Ubaidulla1810/mentor-booking-backend/blob/master/README.md]

3.  **Frontend Installation:**
    * Navigate into the frontend project directory:
        ```bash
        cd mb_frontend
        ```
    * Install frontend dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        # or
        yarn install
        ```

### Running the Application (Frontend)

1.  Ensure your **Spring Boot Backend is running** on `http://localhost:8080`.
2.  Start the frontend development server from the frontend project directory:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
3.  Open your web browser and visit the address provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

The frontend should now be running and able to communicate with your local backend.
